## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### 2025-04-09 Database Health Check Fix

**Issue**: The health check endpoint was failing with `TypeError: (void 0) is not a function` in the `checkDatabaseHealth` function. 

**Root Cause**: The function was trying to use `schema.sql` which doesn't exist. The `sql` template tag should be imported directly from drizzle-orm.

**Solution**: 
1. Added import for `sql` from drizzle-orm: `import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";`
2. Changed `db.execute(schema.sql\`SELECT 1\`)` to `db.execute(sql\`SELECT 1\`)`

**Impact**: This fixes the database health check, ensuring the `/health` endpoint returns proper status codes for monitoring systems.
